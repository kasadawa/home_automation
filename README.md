# HomeAutomation
App specially build for Raspberry Pi devices. 
It's easy to use it for controlling array relays. 
The project is based on: Angular 2 CLI project and node-js server for backend. Controlling the Raspberry is implemented with Johnny-Five library.  
## Wiring
The diagram below is showing how you need to wire you Raspbery with the 4 array relay module:

Then start the server : 
```
node server
```
Open the browser and navigate to ```192.168.100.5:3000```.

The default usename and password are ```admin```.
When you login you can change them from the Advanced option tab. Also after the first login you need to provide your own database:

## Create MongoDB database
Register to [mlab](www.mlab.com), create new database, add collection with name: ```devices``` , include user, copy and paste the generated URI( it should look like ```mongodb://<user>:<password>n@ds117311.mlab.com:17311/mean_test``` ).  
Also Johnny-File requires [Raspi-io](https://github.com/nebrius/raspi-io) to be installed.

## Advanced Tab 
Can configure own username and password, to pass other Database URI and also to extend the pin selection.
